# Gaguna

This is my collection of useful (maybe) utils that I often use in my web projects. The name Gaguna comes from common Indonesian words "ga guna" which means useless, and this library is surely useless for most of you xD

## Features

- Written in Typescript.
- No dependencies.
- Tree shaking friendly.

## Installation

```
npm i gaguna
```

## Usage

This library is just a collection of functions, so just check the documentation for each function.

## FAQ

> **Q**: Why?  
> **A**: Because I often find myself writing some of the functions again and again in my projects (especially random, easings, and debounce).

> **Q**: Can I use it for my project? Is it production ready?  
> **A**: Of cource you can use it for your projects. I don't know if it is production ready. Most are just simple functions so hopefully there are minimal bugs. If you found bugs please report to me or raise an issue or create a PR.
